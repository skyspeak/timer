### Step 1: Download Required Audio Files

You need to download these 5 audio files and place them in the `audio/` folder:

- **Suggestion**: Look for upbeat, energetic music that will wake you up

#### 2. Ambulance Siren (7:05 AM)
- **File**: `ambulance_siren.wav`
- **Search**: "ambulance siren sound effect"
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds
- **Suggestion**: Loud, attention-grabbing siren sound

#### 3. Big Announcement Bells (7:10 AM)
- **File**: `big_announcement_bells.mp3`
- **Search**: "church bells" or "announcement bells"
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds
- **Suggestion**: Deep, resonant bell sounds

#### 4. Relaxing Music (7:15 AM - 20 minutes)

3. **YouTube Audio Library**
   - Go to YouTube Studio > Audio Library

### Step 3: File Placement

1. Download each audio file
2. Rename them to match the exact filenames above
3. Place all files in the `audio/` folder in your timer directory
4. Make sure they are in the correct format (AIFF for wake_up_routine, WAV for ambulance_siren, MP3 for others)

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. Open `test.html` in your browser
2. Click "Test Audio" to verify each file plays
3. Use "Simulate 7:00 AM" to test the full routine
4. Adjust volume settings in the configuration panel

### Alternative: Use Text-to-Speech Only

If you don't want to download audio files, the application will work with just the text-to-speech announcements. The audio files are optional - the TTS messages will still play at the scheduled times.

### Troubleshooting

- **Audio not playing**: Check that files are in the `audio/` folder with exact filenames
- **Volume too loud/quiet**: Adjust audio volume in the settings panel
- **Files not found**: Make sure filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Browser audio issues**: Try clicking on the page first to enable audio playback
